### **8. Multi-Statement Logic (Correct/Incorrect Pairings)**

Identifying these formats is like **categorising tools in a toolbox**; while they all serve the purpose of assessment, knowing whether you need the "precision" of an Assertion-Reason check or the "sorting" of a chronological list is essential for efficiently navigating the exam.
